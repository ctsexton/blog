# About
Writing code is a social activity. I always promote a culture of asking questions and sharing knowledge amongst a team. This improves trust between engineers, and fewer single points of failure mean somebody can always step in to push critical bug fixes. 

As a full stack developer, I aim to deliver user-friendly and reliable software rapidly. I am a generalist with a wide range of experience using modern web development and data analysis tools.

I started off as a programmer developing my own electronic musical instruments, and wrote a thesis on the interface design process. This knowledge translates well to building more general applications, so now I create solutions in a wide variety of contexts.

**Location**: Los Angeles, CA
What I bring to the table:

- A holistic understanding of systems - I make it my business to know how the small details fit into the bigger picture.
- A preference for simple, easy to understand solutions explained with no technical jargon.
- Working code. Readable & documented.
- Humility, mentorship & paying it forward - I love both learning from others and sharing what I have learned. I also worked for several years as a (music) teacher and have a healthy skepticism for expensive code bootcamps.

# Experience
- Stem Disintermedia, Inc.
    What I do at Stem:
     - Build content distribution & financial reporting tools for musicians & record labels.
     - Always pushing to improve documentation and shared understanding of the codebase, raising engineering team resilience.
     - Enthusiastic advocate of pair/mob programming, especially when tackling critical bug fixes and "miscellaneous" requests to the dev team (it raises morale and socializes knowledge of production bugs).
     - Designed a search tool to lookup Spotify & Apple Music catalog metadata, using Javascript, HTML & CSS.
     - Work with our Postgres DB, considering how schema changes will impact on insertion and lookup times.
    Tech stack: React, Node.js, D3, PostgreSQL, GraphQL
- Railstats LA
    Performance tracking for the Los Angeles Metro Rail Network.

    - Led a partnership between Hack for LA & LA Metro to build an open-source on-time performance tool for the train network.
    - Featured talk at LA Counts for Open Data Day 2019, discussing how RailStats LA is built on public APIs.
    - Architected & coded a data analysis engine in Python to track vehicle locations over time and run automated statistical analyses continuously.
    - Optimized Python execution on large data sets with Pandas and Numpy libraries, achieving low computation times under tight resource contraints.
    - Wrote unit tests to improve reliability, resulting in a robust codebase that copes with challenging time and scheduling conditions.
    - Using React and Highcharts, I developed the statistical summary and Marey Diagram views for the front end site.
- Fantasmo
    The decentralized 3D map of the world.

    - Worked with 3D mapping startup to transform geographic datasets.
    - I processed 3D point clouds, collected via cameras mounted on scooters, to produce GeoJSON files outlining major geographic features (streets, sidewalks, construction zones) on a map.
    - Used QGIS to refine and label GeoJSON documents.
    - Developed a CRS (coordinate reference system) tool in Python, which converts Cartesian coordinates to spherical/global coordinates in order to project arbitrary shapes onto maps.

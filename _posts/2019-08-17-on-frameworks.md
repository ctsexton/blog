Web development moves fast. There are new frameworks always coming to help us do more quickly. So many, in fact, that we typically spend more time learning new frameworks than we gain in development time savings from using them (over vanilla JS/CSS).

Well we should remind ourselves that the browser capabilities are also improving over time, reducing the need to rely on third party frameworks to solve legacy browser problems. Take CSS for example. With CSS Grid, there is really no need to use UI libraries just for their "grid" capabilities anymore.
